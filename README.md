# MovieDB
Coding Project For Intermedix

I chose to do the 3rd option, creating the backend of the movie project.  I used MySQL Workbench to create and run a MySQL database, and C# to make a program that runs a SQL command and activates a stored procedure, then displays the results in a text box.

The Files in this repository are:
IntermedixMovieDB.SQL - This is the Database that the C# program interacts with
MoviesMySQL.MWB - This is the MySQL Workbench project
WindowsFormsApp1 - This is the visual studio project

Instructions:

-Open MySQL Workbench and run the "Local instance MySQL Router"
    -User ID: root | Password: Password
-Open MoviesMySQL.mwb in MySQL Workbench
-Click Database -> Forward engineer
-Make sure "intermedixmoviebackenddb" shows up under SCHEMAS

-Run the C# program
    -WindowsFormsApp1/WindowsFormsApp1/bin/WindowsFormsApp1.exe
    -or Open the visual studio solution and run from there
